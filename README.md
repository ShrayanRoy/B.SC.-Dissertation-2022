# Comparison Between Likelihood Ratio Tests and Some Non-Parametric Tests in Two - Sample Problems

I have used simulations to compare the tests obtained from the likelihood ratio tests with non-parametric tests in 
the two-sample problem of equality of means when sampled populations are either normal or exponential. I have assessed the penalty of 
using non-parametric tests instead of using the corresponding LRT (parametric test) when we have sufficient knowledge about the type of 
population sampled (Here, normal and exponential only).

This is my B.SC. Dissertation under respected professor **Pallabi Ghosh** at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata. 
I always believe that *Visual Understanding* is very important. Hence, I have used some beautiful graphics to understand 
the key reasons behind the problem. I hope you will love it!
